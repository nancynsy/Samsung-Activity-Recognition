# Samsung-Activity-Recognition
The data set is originally from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). It is too large to upload here so if you wanna redo the project, simply download it and load in R. \
The goal of this project is to Find a predictive model that uses as few features as possible to predict human activity. My team and I achieved 91% accuracy rate with Random Forest by taking 4 out of 561 features as the final result.
